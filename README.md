# Random Forest Classification and Regression for Predictive Modeling
 This project implements Random Forest models for both classification and regression tasks. The classification task uses the Wine Quality dataset, while the regression task uses the Bike Sharing dataset. Hyperparameters are tuned using 10-fold cross-validation to identify the best settings for both tasks
